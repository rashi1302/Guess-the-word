# Guess-the-word
A guess the word game developed in Python!
Rules of the game:
You have 8 points at the start. I will think of a word. You have to guess the letters that might be in that word. 
If you guess it correctly, I will display the letter. If you guess it incorrectly, you lose a point.
If you are able to guess all the letters in the word, you win. But if you canâ€™t figure it out in time, you lose.
